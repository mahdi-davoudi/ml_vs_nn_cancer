# Cancer Classification using Neural Network and Traditional ML Models

This repository contains machine learning models to classify cancer data, including:
- Neural Networks
- Traditional Machine Learning Models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, KNN)

## Files
- `neural_network.ipynb`: Neural network implementation on the cancer dataset.
- `supervised.ipynb`: (To be added) Traditional ML models implementation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas

## Project Goal
To achieve the highest accuracy with Neural Network and Traditional ML Models
